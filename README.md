# Comparative Analysis of T*-Tree and B+-Tree Performance
Research Paper on BTree and T*tree 

## Overview
This repository contains code and experimental results for a comparative analysis of the performance between T*-Trees and B+-Trees. The analysis focuses on various operations including data insertion, deletion, search, and space complexity. The study aims to provide insights into the relative strengths and weaknesses of these data structures in practical scenarios.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Btree_T-tree.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the directory to access the Python implementations of T*-Tree and B+-Tree data structures.
3. Experimental results, including graphs and data tables, are stored in the `results/` directory for analysis.

## Results
The experimental results provide insights into the performance comparison between T*-Trees and B+-Trees across various operations. The results include comparisons of insertion time, deletion time, search time, range query performance, and space complexity.

## Conclusion
The comparative analysis aims to assist developers and researchers in understanding the trade-offs between T*-Trees and B+-Trees and selecting the most suitable data structure for their specific use cases.
